By default, the output file(s) will contain the predictions, applicability domain and accuracy assessment in csv or txt format.

The default fields are: Molecule ID, predicted value (pred), Applicability domain (AD), Similarity index (Sim_index) and accuracy estimate (Conf_index).

Additional options:

	Separate files:		Separate output file for each endpoint. Recommended if high number of molecules are predicted.
	
	Experimental values:	Include the experimental values based on provided CASRNs or DTXSID in the input file.
	
	Nearest neighbors:	Includes the (3 or 5) nearest neighbors from training set (CAS, InCHiKeys, Observed and predicted values).
	
	Descriptors values:	Output file containing all prediction details and used descriptors (only if output is in csv format).
	
	Descriptors files:	Keep temporary descriptors files (generated during descriptor calculation).
